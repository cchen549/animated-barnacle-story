Character: Chen, a 20-years-old young man
On a normal night in 2020, Chen was playing on his computer.
But he accidentally poured water from the glass onto his keyboard,
which leaked electricity, then Chen fainted.
When he awoke, he found he is in a world he had never seen before.
It was full of different colors and sounds. It looked like he was looking at his room but through a kaleidoscope and in a different dimention.
All of a sudden his world went to darkness. He awoke once again to his normal
room. He was on the floor in a puddle of sweat. Dazed and confused he sat back
in his chair to check on his laptop. But when he looked on his desk, his laptop was gone and all that was left was a pile of skittles.
